<div>
    The code sets up an express server using the express module. Middleware
    functions are added to the server using app.use(). Middleware functions are
    functions that have access to the request and response objects, and can
    perform actions such as logging, modifying the request or response objects, or
    calling the next middleware function in the stack. The server is set up to use
    the EJS template engine to render views. The server is set up to serve static
    files from the "public" directory using express.static(). The server is set up
    to use the methodOverride middleware to allow PUT and DELETE requests to be
    made using HTML forms. The server is set up to use sessions with the
    express-session middleware. Sessions are used to store user-specific data
    across requests. The connect-flash middleware is used to display flash
    messages to the user. The customerRouter is added as a route for the /admin
    path. A 404 error message is sent if none of the other routes match the
    request. Finally, the app object is exported for use in other modules.
